## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:

```
Add file color labeling feature

- Implement color picker component
- Add API endpoint for color updates
- Update file list to display colors
- Fixes #123
```

### JavaScript Styleguide

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

```javascript
/**
 * Uploads files to Google Drive
 * @param {Array} files - Array of files to upload
 * @param {string} folderName - Target folder name
 * @returns {Promise} Upload results
 */
async function uploadFiles(files, folderName) {
  // Implementation here
}
```

### CSS Styleguide

- Use CSS custom properties (variables) when possible
- Follow BEM naming convention for classes
- Group related properties together
- Use meaningful class names

## Project Structure

```
cloud-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js              # Main server file
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json           # Project configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html         # Frontend application
â”œâ”€â”€ uploads/               # Temporary uploads (gitignored)
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                  # Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                 # Test files (if added)
â””â”€â”€ README.md             # Main documentation
```

## API Guidelines

When adding new API endpoints:

1. **Follow RESTful conventions**

   - GET for retrieving data
   - POST for creating/uploading
   - PUT/PATCH for updating
   - DELETE for removing

2. **Use consistent response format**

   ```javascript
   {
     "success": true|false,
     "message": "Descriptive message",
     "data": {...}, // Optional
     "error": "Error message" // Only if success is false
   }
   ```

3. **Add proper error handling**
   ```javascript
   try {
     // Operation here
     res.json({ success: true, message: "Operation successful" });
   } catch (error) {
     console.error("Error description:", error);
     res.status(500).json({
       success: false,
       error: "User-friendly error message",
     });
   }
   ```

## Feature Requests

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Be specific** about the feature you want
